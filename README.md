## Project Overview

ResGrid facilitates the reporting and management of disaster incidents with the following core functionalities:
- **Real-time incident reporting** and information sharing.
- **Intelligent resource allocation** based on incident severity.
- **Continuous monitoring** of incident status and resource deployment.
- **Collaborative communication** between stakeholders for coordinated disaster response.

## Features

- **Incident Reporting Service**: Enables users to submit detailed reports, including location, type, and severity of incidents, for quick information gathering.
- **Severity Analysis**: Uses machine learning algorithms to assess incident data and determine appropriate response levels.
- **Resource Allocation**: Dynamically allocates resources to high-priority areas based on incident severity, optimizing response time and effectiveness.
- **Communication and Coordination**: Provides a real-time communication channel for stakeholders to ensure coordinated efforts.
- **Real-Time Monitoring and Visualization**: Offers up-to-the-minute information on incident status and resource deployment, with clear data visualization to support informed decision-making.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates reports on incidents and resource usage, enabling post-incident analysis and continuous improvement.

## System Architecture

The system is designed with a **modular microservices architecture** that enhances maintainability and scalability. Each microservice independently manages specific functionalities, including:
- **Incident Report Service**: Handles user-submitted reports on incidents.
- **Severity Analysis Service**: Analyzes incident data using machine learning to determine response levels.
- **Resource Generator Service**: Allocates resources dynamically based on incident severity.
- **Communication Service**: Manages real-time information flow between all relevant stakeholders.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Constantly tracks incidents and resource status, providing real-time updates to stakeholders.
- **Data Visualization**: Offers easy-to-read visuals for better decision-making during crisis situations.

The entire application is containerized using Docker, which simplifies deployment and ensures consistency across environments. Netflix Conductor orchestrates workflows for smooth task automation and efficient resource allocation.
